Dependencies(will need to update):
pip install ultralytics
pip install roboflow

Custom Models:
Inside this folder are two custom models trained to dectect objects from an aerial view. 
The model name rf3v1 is trained using RoboFlow 3.0 while the one called yolov11Custom is trained using YOLOV11.

Detect.py:
This script is what will run the computer vision models. To use this script use "python detect.py 0".
Inside the code you can change the desired model to use(yolov11Custom or rf3v1).

**need to change the device handling the load from cpu to the gpu

Runs:
After running the script all data such as the JSON files and video captures are stored in the runs folder within a subfolder named after the name of the model used to capture the data.
